If you need help understanding the content of these sample scripts, it is highly
recommended that you read the <a href="../../../wiki">wiki documentation</a>.

These sample custom platform scripts are organized by the protocol used for managing
the asset.  Currently, Safeguard custom platforms support: 
<a href="SSH">SSH</a>,
<a href="Telnet">Telnet (TN3270)</a>, and
<a href="HTTP">HTTP</a>.

It may be possible to support a particular platform using more than one protocol.

Please refer to the Safeguard product documentation for instructions on uploading
a custom platform script and creating an asset.
